# gesture-mouse-
code is using the OpenCV and autopy libraries to detect hand gestures and use them to move and click the mouse cursor. It captures video from the user's webcam and uses a hand detection module to detect the user's hand and identify the position of the index and middle fingers. Depending on the position of these fingers, the program either moves the mouse cursor or clicks the left mouse button. The program also displays the FPS and the video feed with circles drawn around the index and middle fingers.
